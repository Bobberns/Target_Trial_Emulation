### FOR SIR GERARD, READ THIS NOTICE REAL QUICK PLEASEE

There seems to be a rendering issue on how some of our markdown blocks are appearing in this repository's main - especially in the **TTE-v2.ipynb** file. Some blank spaces are present on areas on what should have been our markdown code should be in. Perhaps this may just be cross-checked with the **TTE-v1.ipynb** file. I think this is some bug? Everything looks fine on our local, it's just how the file seems to appear in the repo.

Despite this, the code blocks where the clusters happen seems to render just fine in this repo so far. We're just not really sure how to fix the blank spaces issue; when in our local the entire file renders normally. We are working into it.

# [Assignment #3] Target Trial Emulation

**Assignment 1 for Clustering**

New and novel methods in Machine Learning are made either by borrowing formulas and concepts from other scientific fields and redefining it based on new sets of assumptions, or by adding an extra step to an already existing framework of methodology.

In this exercise, we will try to develop a novel method of Target Trial Emulation by integrating concepts of Clustering into the already existing framework. Target Trial Emulation is a new methodological framework in epidemiology which tries to account for the biases in old and traditional designs.

*These are the instructions:*
1. Look at this website: https://rpubs.com/alanyang0924/TTE
2. Extract the dummy data in the package and save it as "data_censored.csv"
2. Convert the R codes into Python Codes (use Jupyter Notebook), replicate the results using your python code.
3. Create another copy of your Python Codes, name it TTE-v2 (use Jupyter Notebook).
4. Using TTE-v2, think of a creative way on where you would integrate a clustering mechanism, understand each step carefully and decide at which step a clustering method can be implemented. Generate insights from your results.
5. Do this by pair, preferably your thesis partner.
6. Push to your github repository.

**HINT:** For those who dont have a thesis topic yet, you can actually develop a thesis topic out of this assignment.

*"I  dont mind you use A.I. tools with this assignment, but if you do please include your prompts in the submission."*
